 <string name="gameData.store.characterDesc.Ashani">Ashani is the audience surrogate, a normal girl just like you and me who is from plain old Earth and is not exceptional in any way. She is exceptionally brilliant, one of the foremost scientific minds in the galaxy, a world class expert in martial arts, an Olympic level athlete, and is extremely charming and likeable. Her unique inventions allow her to punch Xanas' in faces really, really, REALLY hard. She could probably quote the impact force in Newtons, but we can't so just forget about it.</string>
